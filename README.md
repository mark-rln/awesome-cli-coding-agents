A curated list of **130+ CLI coding agents** — AI-powered tools that live in your terminal, read/edit repos, and run commands — plus the **harnesses** that orchestrate, sandbox, or extend them.

> **Last updated:** 2026-09-28

### What is a CLI coding agent?

A CLI coding agent is an AI-powered tool that runs in your terminal and can autonomously read, write, and execute code in your repository. Unlike chat-based assistants, these agents have direct access to your filesystem, shell, and dev tools — they can edit files, run tests, commit changes, and iterate on errors. Think of them as AI pair programmers that live where you already work: the command line.

MIT.

- **[Verity](https://github.com/codacy/verity)** `⭐ 4` — Stop-hook review gate and knowledge base for Claude Code: when the agent stops, an adversarial model, backed by Codacy's deterministic analysis CLI, checks the diff for security, quality and intent against the original prompt, then passes it or blocks with file-and-line findings the agent fixes. Claude Code plugin (9 skills, 6 hooks) over the `verity` CLI, npm `@codacy/verity-cli`. macOS only. Plugin Apache-2.0; CLI proprietary, free in beta.

- **[agent-trace](https://github.com/ertygiq/agent-trace)** `⭐ 3` — Text-only CLI for extracting filtered transcripts from Claude Code, Codex, and Pi session files; useful for debugging, review, and piping transcripts into other tools. MIT.

- **[Weaver](https://github.com/sean35mm/weaver)** `⭐ 3` — Local coordination layer for multiple coding agents working in the same repo. Agents announce tasks, claim paths/globs, check overlaps, and leave repo-local notes through a shared SQLite store. MIT.

- **[Hivelore](https://github.com/Doucs91/hivelore)** `⭐ 3` — Deterministic policy gate for agent-written code: a lesson captured via MCP (`mem_tried`) becomes a validated regex/AST/test guard that Git hooks and CI use to refuse any diff reintroducing the documented mistake; briefs any agent with the team's repo-specific rules over MCP. TypeScript CLI, npm (`@hivelore/cli`). Apache-2.0.

- **[opencode-agent-memory](https://github.com/Ghilteras/opencode-agent-memory)** `⭐ 3` — Persistent, self-editable memory blocks and an optional append-only journal with local semantic search for the OpenCode AI coding agent. npm `@ghilteras/opencode-agent-memory`. TypeScript, MIT.

- **[wt](https://github.com/sahil87/wt)** `⭐ 2` — Small Go CLI wrapping `git worktree` with opinionated defaults for the parallel-agent workflow: worktrees as siblings of the main repo, memorable adjective-noun names, and a shell wrapper that makes `cd`-from-a-menu actually work, so each AI session gets its own checkout. MIT.

- **[distro-rig-vps](https://github.com/shafir-info/distro-rig-vps)** `⭐ 2` — Disposable real-boot Linux VMs for coding agents that need guest root, without host sudo/KVM/libvirt access. Deny-by-default egress and clean recreate. GPL-3.0.

- **[stratless](https://github.com/stratless-ai/stratless)** `⭐ 2` — Derives Claude Code and Codex skills from your own session history: clusters recurring moments locally, has your own assistant name them, and cites the evidence count behind every proposed skill before installing to `~/.claude/skills`. Zero runtime dependencies, nothing leaves the machine. npm `stratless`, TypeScript. MIT.

- **[BlaBla](https://github.com/Kiborgik/blabla)** `⭐ 2` — Rust CLI that keeps project intent as executable contracts a coding agent queries instead of re-reading chat history: behavior rules checked by a coverage-guided campaign that shrinks a failure to a minimized counterexample, structure rules (modules, symbols, dependencies, literal collection membership) evaluated statically by a Python `ast` provider in an isolated interpreter that never imports project code, and `blabla finish` as a completion gate that exits 0 only when every active layer is GREEN. v0.7.0-alpha, Python-only structure provider. MIT.

- **[Squelette](https://github.com/JyMinet/squelette)** `⭐ 2` — Governance layer for CLI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex): human decisions and allowed scope recorded before work, a pre-commit gate that refuses out-of-scope changes, and closure only on checked proof. MIT.

- **[claude-northstar](https://github.com/Nisarg38/claude-northstar)** `⭐ 1` — Transforms CLI agents from task executors into autonomous project partners.

- **[UACOS](https://github.com/caotiensinh/uacos)** `⭐ 1` — Local-first code intelligence and orchestration toolkit: dependency-graph impact analysis, context compression, patch-scope safety gates, transaction rollback, and a job-based runtime for coding agents. No cloud dependency. Python, MIT.

- **[llm-panel](https://github.com/musharna/llm-panel)** `⭐ 1` — Put one question or diff to several LLM CLIs in parallel (codex, claude, opencode/OpenRouter, ollama); every answer shown in full, an anonymized rebuttal round, cost accounting, a GitHub Action, and a measured miss rate on AACR-Bench. Python, PyPI `llm-panel`. MIT.

- **[Mantyl](https://github.com/jopli11/mantyl-cli)** `⭐ 1` — Handover layer for AI-built software: compiles a repo plus Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor session history into a verified project passport (sandbox-executed checks, claim/contradiction detection, secret redaction) that the recipient independently re-runs via `mantyl receive`. npm `mantyl`. MIT.

- **[CodeVetter](https://github.com/Codevetter/codevetter)** `⭐ 1` — Execution-backed verification for AI-written changes: proves a change satisfies its requested task by running the evidence checks locally and recording inspectable, source-bound receipts. macOS app, CLI, read-only MCP. MIT.

- **[isitdone](https://github.com/raimondasl/isitdone)** `⭐ 1` — Stop hook and CLI that blocks a coding agent's "done" until the repo's real test, typecheck and lint commands pass on the exact working tree; scans the diff for weakened tests and leaves a git-bound PASS/FAIL/STALE receipt. One `init` command per host for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, Qwen Code, Goose, Droid, Devin, Auggie, OpenCode and Junie, plus an MCP server for agents without hooks. Zero LLM calls, zero dependencies. npm `isitdone`. MIT.

- **[Agent Fleet](https://woodor.ai/agent-fleet/)** — Messaging layer for coding-agent sessions: every live Claude Code or Codex session takes a `name@project` address, and sessions exchange messages and files on one machine, across a LAN, or across networks. Also does remote session lifecycle control — compact, clear, handoff, restart. Native on macOS, Windows (x64 and arm64), and Linux x64, with no WSL or tmux. Closed source; free on a local network, paid cloud relay.
